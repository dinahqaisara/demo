     		<p>This is where I will be documenting my experience in FabLab throughout my internship period which lasts 6 months.</p>

               <p>This is the workshop where I am stationed at. It's at T14, level 4. Opposite me are the other interns, Su, my classmate and Kai Ern.<p>
               
               <h2>Week 1</h2>
               <h3>13-17 September 2021</h3>
               <p><b>Day 1, 13 Sept:</b> We went through a briefing about the rules and basic information about the workshops. Afterwards we were brought around to the T11 and Maker Space workshops. I had a little get to know session with my supervisor, Mr Rodney, and he went through a list of softwares and links for me to go through. With that, my first task was to create this website through CSS and HTML with the help of a tutorial by Jake Wright.</p>

               <p><b>Day 2, 14 Sept:</b> Cleaning of workshop and getting to know more about where each tool belongs in. Mr Yeo taught us how to use Cura, which is a 3D printing software. After that, one of the interns were tasked to print something out, so before that, we were taught how to use and maintain both the Ultimaker 2+ and Ender 3D printers. </p>

               <p><b>Day 3, 15 Sept:</b> We sat through this presentation where the EA (Engineering Academy) students talked about their inventions and their process throughout. We got to see the students inventions up close too. After the meeting was over, I tried callibrating / fine tuning the 3D printer (as some sort of practice) before printing something. </p>

               <p><b>Day 4, 16 Sept:</b> Went through a deeper guide on how to use the Ender printer. Mr Rodney gave me some tutorials to get me started on Fusion360. Fusion360 is a software where most designers would use to create their stuff in 3D before actually using machines to make the item come to life.</p>

               <p><b>Day 5, 17 Sept:</b> We sat through this presentation where the EA (Engineering Academy) students talked about their inventions and their process throughout. We got to see the students inventions up close too. After the meeting was over, I tried callibrating / fine tuning the 3D printer (as some sort of practice) before printing something. </p>

               <h2>Week 2</h2>
               <h3>20-24 September 2021</h3>
               
               <p><b>Day 6, 20 Sept:</b> We were tasked to go to the physics lab at T7 and sort out items for the PFP students' module class. After lunch my supervisor showed a bunch of kinetic sculptures that wishes to work on for his upcoming project. </p>

               <p><b>Day 7, 21 Sept:</b> We were taugh how to convert a Fusion360 file into a .dxf file so we could use it on CorelDraw (software used before laser cutting). Later on, we went to try out and also learned how to use the laser cutter machine. After we were done, we were taught on how to solder.</p>

               <p><b>Day 8, 22 Sept:</b> Mr Rodney gave us a small task to do which was to make a music box on Fusion360.</p>

               <p><b>Day 9, 23 Sept:</b> We went to MakerSpace and one of the part-time workers taught us how to use the laser cutter machines (different from the ones we used at T11 and much simpler). We learned to laser cut and engraved a few keychains for ourselves.</p>

               <p><b>Day 10, 24 Sept:</b> We managed to laser cut out music boxes at T11 and tried ensembling it. Mr Rodney then taught us how to solder crocodile pins and we got to keep a pair for ourselves so we could use it in the future.</p>

               <h2>Week 3</h2>
