               <p>This is the workshop where I am stationed at. It's at T14, level 4. Opposite me are the other interns, Su, my classmate and Kai Ern.<p>

               <h3>13-17 September 2021</h3>
               <p>**Day 1, 13 Sept:** We went through a briefing about the rules and basic information about the workshops. Afterwards we were brought around to the T11 and Maker Space workshops. I had a little get to know session with my supervisor, Mr Rodney, and he went through a list of softwares and links for me to go through. With that, my first task was to create this website through CSS and HTML with the help of a tutorial by Jake Wright.</p>

               <p>**Day 2, 14 Sept:** Cleaning of workshop and getting to know more about where each tool belongs in. Mr Yeo taught us how to use Cura, which is a 3D printing software. After that, one of the interns were tasked to print something out, so before that, we were taught how to use and maintain both the Ultimaker 2+ and Ender 3D printers. </p>

               <p>**Day 3, 15 Sept:** We sat through this presentation where the EA (Engineering Academy) students talked about their inventions and their process throughout. We got to see the students inventions up close too. After the meeting was over, I tried callibrating / fine tuning the 3D printer (as some sort of practice) before printing something. </p>

               <p>**Day 4, 16 Sept:** Went through a deeper guide on how to use the Ender printer. Mr Rodney gave me some tutorials to get me started on Fusion360. Fusion360 is a software where most designers would use to create their stuff in 3D before actually using machines to make the item come to life.</p>
